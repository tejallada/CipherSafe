Instructions to run the code:
1) Due to github file size policy (under 100mb) go to https://weakpass.com/wordlists/rockyou.txt and download the rockyout.txt data set from the website and put it into the "Data folder"
2) On whatever IDE you are running the program on, configure it to run "src/main.cpp" file
3) Once the program starts running it will take approximately 1 minute to populate both the data sets
4) After the data structures are populated with the data from the rockyou.txt data set the options menu will show up and you will enter an integer 1-4 to make your selection from the provided options
5) Option 1 will give you a strength check of a password in which you will enter your password when prompted, it will then return the strength of the password as well as the reason why it is that strength
6) Option 2 will generate a strong password for you in which you will provide the length of the password you would like to have
7) Option 3 will display the statistics of the program including the individual datasets population time, number of passwords loaded into each dataset, and also the average search time (will only display data if the data structure was used in option 1)
8) Option 4 will exit the program
